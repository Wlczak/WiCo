# WiCo
This is the repository of the **WiCo** project. **WiCo** has the goal of simplifying network interfaces on ESP microcontrollers so they can be easily used with simple functions. 
## Disclaimer
It has only been tested with the **ESP8266** based Wemos D1R2 microcontroller and the library is in **early stages of developement**.
